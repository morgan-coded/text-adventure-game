# Upper‑Level Electives

This folder holds materials for any additional upper‑level electives at the 200‑, 300‑, or 400‑level in CS, CYB, DAD, DAT, GAM, or IT that are required to complete the degree.  Since the specific elective has not yet been chosen, use this directory generically until a course is selected.

When you enrol in an elective, create a subfolder named after the course (e.g., `DAT200_Data_Analytics`) and place all assignments, notes, and projects there.
