# CS 218/300 – Database Systems / Structured Database Environments

This folder serves both **CS 218 – Data Structures & Algorithms** and **CS 300 – Database Systems**, since the audit lists one of these courses as still required.  Depending on your final schedule, populate this directory with:

* ER diagrams and relational schema designs.
* SQL scripts for creating, populating, and querying databases.
* Algorithms analyses or data‑structure implementations if CS 218 is taken.

Mark deliverables clearly so it is obvious which course they belong to.
