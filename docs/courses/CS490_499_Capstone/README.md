# CS 490/499 – Computer Science Capstone or Internship

This directory will eventually contain deliverables for the culminating experience of the degree, either **CS 490 – Computer Science Capstone** or **CS 499 – Computer Science Internship/Capstone**.  It will overlap heavily with the work in `docs/capstone/` since the Kids' Math Quest game is intended to satisfy the capstone requirement.

Include here:

* Capstone proposal and project charter.
* Mid‑project presentations and progress reports.
* Final capstone report, code, and any deployment instructions.
