# CS 305 – Software Testing & Automation Quality Assurance

This folder will house assignments for **CS 305 – Software Test and Automation QA**, a course you still need.  Expect to study unit testing, integration testing, automated test frameworks, and quality assurance processes.

Potential artifacts:

* Test plans and test case documents.
* Automated test scripts (e.g., using JUnit, pytest, or Selenium).
* Reports analysing code coverage and defect metrics.
