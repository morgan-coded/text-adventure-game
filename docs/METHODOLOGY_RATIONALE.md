# Methodology Rationale: Agile vs Waterfall

## Why Waterfall is risky here
- requirements are unstable (seasonal demand, tourist behavior, pricing shifts)
- changes late in the process become expensive "change orders"
- client visibility is low during implementation ("black box" period)
- testing occurs late; discovering UX issues late is costly

## Why Agile fits this case
- iterative delivery (MVP first, expand based on feedback)
- supports experimentation (fail fast on features that don't move conversion)
- better stakeholder feedback loop
- backlog-driven improvements aligned to real KPIs and seasonal needs

## Tradeoffs
- requires ongoing stakeholder involvement
- must manage scope creep with backlog discipline
