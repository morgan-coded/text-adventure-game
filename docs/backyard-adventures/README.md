# Backyard Adventures Case Study

This subfolder contains the analysis and design documents for the **Backyard Adventures Reservation System**.  These documents were the basis for a prior systems‑analysis course project and have been retained as portfolio material.  The files include:

* `CASE_STUDY_BackyardAdventures.md` – business context and problem statement.
* `REQUIREMENTS.md` – functional/non‑functional requirements and use cases.
* `DB_SCHEMA.md` – proposed relational database schema.
* `TESTING_AND_ACCEPTANCE.md` – test strategy and user acceptance plan.
* `DEPLOYMENT_AND_METRICS.md` – implementation approach and success metrics.
* `MAINTENANCE_AND_KNOWLEDGE.md` – maintenance strategy and knowledge retention policy.
* `METHODOLOGY_RATIONALE.md` – rationale for choosing Agile over Waterfall.

These documents should remain unchanged as historical artifacts.  If you refine or extend the reservation system in future courses, make copies of the originals and place updates in a new folder so that the original case study stays intact.
