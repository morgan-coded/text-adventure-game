# OS Simulators – Documentation Guide

This folder documents the operating‑system simulator modules that were part of earlier coursework.  The simulators are located in the `src/` directory of this repository and include:

* **file_memory_manager.py** – demonstrates file‑based memory allocation and management.
* **memory_allocation_sim.py** – simulates dynamic memory allocation strategies (e.g., first fit, best fit).
* **realtime_scheduler.py** – models real‑time process scheduling with priorities and deadlines.

## How to use

* Review each simulator's `README.md` or comments within the code for instructions on compilation and usage.
* Sample input files are provided in `/data/` (e.g., `sample_input_realtime.txt`) to test the real‑time scheduler.

## Documentation conventions

When writing or updating documentation for these simulators, use simple explanations, describe the purpose of each module, and include example usage.  Keep a change log if you modify the simulators for later assignments or demonstrations.
