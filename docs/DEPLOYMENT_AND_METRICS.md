# Implementation Approach

## Data migration
- migrate current and upcoming reservations
- migrate limited customer list as needed
- archive older binder history; import later only if required

## Training plan (2 days)
Day 1:
- navigation, creating bookings, confirmations
Day 2:
- exceptions: refunds, weather cancellations, maintenance holds, conflict resolution

## Go-live strategy
- phased rollout to reduce risk:
  - launch online booking + admin tools together
  - tighten rules/policies as staff gets comfortable

# Post-Implementation Evaluation (Success Metrics)

30-day review:
- booking error rate
- average time to complete a reservation
- total online bookings

60-day review:
- customer feedback (follow-up emails/reviews)
- operational metric: manual corrections per week

90-day review:
- revenue trends compared to the same period last year
If KPIs miss targets, prioritize fixes in the next sprint rather than waiting for a major rewrite.
