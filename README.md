# OS Simulators (Study.com projects)

This repo contains small OS-focused simulators written in Python:
- Dynamic memory allocation (Best/First/Worst fit) with free-block coalescing
- File management + memory interaction using linked allocation fragments
- Real-time job scheduling simulator (RM/DM/EDF) using next-event simulation

Each project includes:
- Source code in /src
- Any sample inputs in /data
- The submitted write-ups in /docs

## Run

```bash
python src/memory_allocation_sim.py
python src/file_memory_manager.py
python src/realtime_scheduler.py
```

## Notes

These were originally created for coursework, then cleaned up and expanded for portfolio/capstone enhancement purposes.
