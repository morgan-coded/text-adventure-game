# Backyard Adventures Reservation System (Capstone Enhancement Candidate)

This repository is a capstone enhancement candidate based on a systems analysis and design case study for "Backyard Adventures," a small guided tour and water-sports rental company in Jacksonville, Florida.

The business problem: the company gets ad traffic, but bookings are not converting reliably due to a manual binder + spreadsheet workflow that causes double-booking risk, slow communication, and poor visibility into inventory status.

The proposed solution: a web-based reservation + inventory system with real-time availability, inventory locking, admin scheduling tools, automated confirmations/reminders, reporting, and a maintenance plan designed for seasonal spikes.

## What's in this repo
- docs/CASE_STUDY_BackyardAdventures.md — business context + system overview
- docs/REQUIREMENTS.md — functional + non-functional requirements and use cases
- docs/DB_SCHEMA.md — proposed relational schema (tables/keys/indexes)
- docs/TESTING_AND_ACCEPTANCE.md — testing strategy and UAT scenarios
- docs/DEPLOYMENT_AND_METRICS.md — phased rollout + 30/60/90 day success metrics
- docs/MAINTENANCE_AND_KNOWLEDGE.md — maintenance strategy + knowledge retention policy
- docs/METHODOLOGY_RATIONALE.md — Agile vs Waterfall recommendation

## Capstone enhancement direction (planned)
Enhancement will focus on implementing the core booking workflow first (MVP), then iterating features (reporting, discounts, maintenance holds, admin workflow improvements) based on measurable KPIs and user feedback.

## References / Prior design work
See the documents in /docs for the original analysis and design artifacts used as the basis for the enhancement plan.
